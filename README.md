# CORE-OM Reference values (AT)

# Summary
The [Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM)](https://www.coresystemtrust.org.uk/home/translations/german/) is a multilingual self-report questionnaire designed to monitor mental health services and assess outcomes after psychotherapy and counseling. We provide reference values obtained from an Austrian general population sample (N = 2004) stratified by gender and age to facilitate the interpretation of CORE-OM scores obtained in clinical samples.
